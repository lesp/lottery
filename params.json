{"name":"Lottery Number Generator","tagline":"Lottery number generator project for Blackpool LUG & Makerspace 14th December 2013","body":"This is a simple project for Blackpool LUG and Makerspace.\r\nThe object of the code is to create a list that contains 1 to 49.\r\nThen shuffle the list (great idea by Tim Hastings) and print the first 7 numbers by using variables as a method of storage.\r\nWe could just print the number straight from the list, but I wanted to use variables as this is a demo for our young hacker Kieran.\r\n\r\nAll code is open source and you can adapt and reuse as you see fit.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLes\r\nbigl.es\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
