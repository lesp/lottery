This is a simple project for Blackpool LUG and Makerspace.
The object of the code is to create a list that contains 1 to 49.
Then shuffle the list (great idea by Tim Hastings) and print the first 7 numbers by using variables as a method of storage.
We could just print the number straight from the list, but I wanted to use variables as this is a demo for our young hacker Kieran.

All code is open source and you can adapt and reuse as you see fit.

Thanks
